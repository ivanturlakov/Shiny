  <h1>We’re hiring. You looking?</h1>
  
  <p>Shiny is a marketing agency that drives its clients’ business by creating the customer engagement that is necessary to be successful in the “age of distraction.” We do this by developing brand experiences that actually move people to action. If a customer cannot easily complete a task or take an action on your site or through other media, we cannot achieve success as a team.  Ultimately, our shared goal is to rise above the noise in the market place and create solutions that shine.</p>
